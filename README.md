Map species distribution as obtained from an occupancy model
===========================================================

This contains R code to build a map of occupancy probability estimates, using a case study on lynx in the French Alps.
In details, a single-season occupancy model was fitted to detection/non-detection data; initial occupancy was a function of forest cover 
while species detection had a site-random effect on it.

More details on the estimation step in Gimenez, O., L. Blanc, A. Besnard, R. Pradel, P. F. Doherty Jr, E. Marboutin and R. Choquet (2014).
